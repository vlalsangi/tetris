# tetris
This is a Tetris project. The objective is simple- keep clearing rows of blocks by filling up rows until the stack reaches the top. 

This version allows you to control several variables, such as the size of the game (row/column size), the actual size of the game (window size), and how often new blocks are generated through the "tetris-pref.txt" file.
